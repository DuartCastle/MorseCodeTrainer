## About

This program helps you learn Morse code interactively!

You can:

- Practice letters in weekly groups
- Send random words and sentences built from each week's letters
- Send random call signs, numbers, and punctuation
- Enter your own text to send in Morse code
- Adjust tone frequency and speed (WPM)
- Use Flash Card Mode to display large letters as they are sent
- Toggle dot-dash display for reference

Morse code is an **audible language**—be sure to turn off the visual dot-dash display as soon as you can.

**Practice at least 15 minutes per day.**  
Do not move to the next week’s letters until you can copy the current week’s letters confidently.

When you have memorized all letters, numbers, and punctuation, you can practice with mixed random selections.

**GOOD LUCK—ENJOY LEARNING!**

### Windows

1. Install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Open **Command Prompt**.
3. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install pygame numpy
    ```

4. *(Optional)* Create a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python -m venv pyEnv
    pyEnv\Scripts\activate
    ```

---

### macOS and Linux

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed:

    ```sh
    python3 --version
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip3 install pygame numpy
    ```

3. *(Optional)* Create a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv pyEnv
    source pyEnv/bin/activate
    ```

## Important Files

Make sure the following files are located in the **same folder** before running the program:

- `morsecode.py` – the main program.
- `ascii_letters.py` – provides the large letter display for Flash Card Mode.

If `ascii_letters.py` is missing or not in the same directory as `morsecode.py`, the program will not start and you will see an error similar to:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ascii_letters'
```

## Acknowledgment

This program’s method and sequence for learning Morse Code are inspired by the work of **Mike Aretsky, N6MQL**.

Mike was a beloved ham radio leader, Morse code advocate, accomplished engineer, and community pillar. His passions spanned amateur radio, music, electronics, and service—leaving a vibrant legacy respected by many in the Sacramento Valley.

This project is dedicated to his memory and to his commitment to sharing Morse Code with new generations.
