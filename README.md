## About

This program will teach you to learn morse code!

The program is laid out with menu selections for speed of wpm selection
tone selection, and other features. The menu has weekly selections to
learn given letters for that week, Make sure you spend at least 15
minutes per day on each week's letters. Do not go onto the next week's
letters until you have the week letters you are working on down pat.
The menu is self explanatory. There is a menu to turn on or off the dot
dash display of the letter being sent. Morse code is an audible language.
The dot dash display should be off as soon as possible. Each week's
letters that are selected will be sent at random. Once all the letters,
numbers and puctuation are 100% memorized, there is a selction to send
all letters, numbers, and punctuation at random. You can also make a
selection to type letters numbers puctuation making up mixed characters,
numbers and punctuation and they will be sent back in morse code.
